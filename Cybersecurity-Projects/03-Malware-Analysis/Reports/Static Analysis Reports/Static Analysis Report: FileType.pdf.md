## File Packing Analysis

**Packing Detection Tool: `PEiD`
- Result: File is not packed.
- Explanation: Packing is a technique where files are compressed or encrypted to hide their contents, often used by malware to make analysis harder. A file not being packed means it is in its original form, making it straightforward to examine and understand its behavior.

**Packing Detection Tool: `PE-Bear`:**
- Result: File is not packed
- Explanation: Under Section file showing as `.text` which indicates that file is not packed.

## Extract Hidden data 

### Strings Extraction
- Command Line: `strings FileType.pdf`
  -  **Purpose:** Extract readable data from the file.

### FLOSS Analysis

- Command Line: `FLOSS.exe FileType.pdf`
  - **Purpose:** Extract both human-readable strings and obfuscated strings.
  - **Details:**
    - FLOSS identified obfuscated strings, which are often encoded or hidden within malicious files. For example, strings might appear as scrambled text or numeric codes that hide URLs, IP addresses, or commands. These strings are significant in malware analysis because they often reveal the file's intent or connections to external systems when decoded.
    - Potentially malicious elements, such as URLs, IP addresses, or commands embedded in the file, were extracted for review.

## File Behavioral Analysis

- Command Line: `capa.exe FileType.pdf`
  - **Purpose:** Identify capabilities and functionalities within the file.
  - **Details:**
    - CAPA detected behaviors such as:
      - Potential network communication: This could indicate attempts by the file to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server, which is commonly used by attackers to control malware remotely.
      - File creation and modification: This suggests that the file may create, modify, or delete system files, potentially altering the system state to achieve its objectives.
      - Registry key interaction: Interacting with the Windows Registry might indicate an attempt to establish persistence, configure system settings, or disable security features.
    - This provides insight into the potential actions of the file without executing it, helping to understand its operational intent.
