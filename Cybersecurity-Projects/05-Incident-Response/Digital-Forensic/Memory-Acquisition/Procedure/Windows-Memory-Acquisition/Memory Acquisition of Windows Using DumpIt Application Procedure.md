#### Step 7: Begin Memory Acquisition
Type **"y"** when prompted to confirm the start of the memory acquisition process. DumpIt will begin capturing the system's memory and saving it as a file on the pendrive. The file size will depend on the amount of RAM in the machine.

#### Step 8: File Creation
After the process completes, a memory dump file will be saved in the pendrive. This file contains the complete memory state of the system at the time of acquisition, including volatile data that could be lost upon shutting down the system.

#### Step 9: Safely Eject the Pendrive
For data integrity, always safely eject the pendrive. This ensures that the memory dump file remains intact and prevents potential data loss.

#### Step 10: Analyze the Memory Dump
With the memory dump file safely stored, connect the pendrive to a dedicated forensic workstation. Use forensic tools to analyze the memory dump and identify potential malicious activity or software on the affected system.

### Recommended Forensic Analysis Tools

The tools listed below are essential for examining the memory dump file, helping investigators uncover evidence of malicious activity or suspicious software behavior, such as unauthorized processes, hidden network connections, or malicious code fragments.

Below are some commonly used tools for analyzing memory dumps:

1. **Volatility**: Open-source tool for memory forensics, capable of extracting and analyzing artifacts like processes, network connections, and loaded modules.
2. **Autopsy**: User-friendly platform for memory and disk analysis.
3. **FTK Imager**: Tool for creating and examining forensic images, including memory dumps.
4. **Redline**: Focuses on memory and malware analysis.
5. **Rekall**: A forensic tool designed for analyzing volatile memory images.
6. **Wireshark**: While primarily a network analysis tool, it can be used for network-related data found in memory dumps.

### Important Notes:
- The memory dump file size matches the systemâ€™s RAM. Ensure the pendrive has enough space.
- Always perform the process on a trusted and isolated analysis system to prevent further compromise.
- Use trusted forensic tools for analyzing the memory dump.

This guide ensures a methodical and professional approach to digital forensic memory acquisition, maintaining the integrity of evidence for subsequent analysis.
