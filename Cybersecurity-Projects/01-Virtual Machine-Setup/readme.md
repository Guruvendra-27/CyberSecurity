## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Pick your hypervisor**:  
   - If you already have a VMware license or want the feature‚Äërich Workstation Pro, head to `VMware/INSTALLATION_SETUP.md`.  
   - Otherwise, Oracle VM VirtualBox is free and cross‚Äëplatform‚Äîsee `Virtual-Box/INSTALLATION_SETUP.md`.

2. **Follow the INSTALLATION_SETUP.md** inside the chosen directory. It will walk you through downloading, installing, enabling virtualization, and configuring network adapters for lab use.

3. **Import the sample VM**:  
   - In VMware: File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí `sample-vm-config.vmx`  
   - In VirtualBox: File ‚Üí Import Appliance ‚Üí `sample-vm-config.vbox`

4. **Power on and verify** connectivity (e.g., ping your host or other VMs).
